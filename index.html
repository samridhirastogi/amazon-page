              <p> Cats are the ultimate masterminds of mischief, wrapped in a fur coat of pure cuteness. They’ll stare at you like they’ve just discovered the meaning of life, only to knock over a glass of water just because it was standing there too confidently. These furry ninjas can leap across the room with the grace of an Olympic athlete, only to land in a box that’s clearly two sizes too small. And let’s not forget their uncanny ability to nap for 18 hours straight, only waking up at 3 AM to perform a solo concert, complete with interpretive dance moves across your face. Cats: because why have a pet when you can have a tiny, four-legged comedian who believes they’re in charge of the universe? </p>

How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety: And Abstinence, Drugs, Satanism, and Other Dangers That Threaten Their Nine Lives

by Zachary Auburn (Author)

Long gone are the good old days when a cat’s biggest worries were mean dogs or a bath. Modern cats must confront satanists, online predators, the possibility of needing to survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and countless other threats to their nine lives.

For over four decades, the American Association of Patriots have stood at the vanguard of our country's defense by helping to prepare our nation's cat owners for the difficult conversations they dread having with their pets.

Written in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety answers crucial questions such as, “What is the right age to talk to my cat about the proper use of firearms?” and “What are the benefits of my cat living a lifestyle of abstinence?” and especially “Why does my cat need to use the internet? Can’t he just play with yarn like cats used to do?”
